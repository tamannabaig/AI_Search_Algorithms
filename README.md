# AI_Search_Algorithms

This project was created as part of coursework for my Artificial Intelligence course.
The task is to implement a number of search algorithms to guide an agent through a grid-based world.
For simplicity, we'll assume that the state space is 2-dimensional, consisting of the grid location of the agent.

The python file search.py consists implementation for 3 of the main search algorithms:
1. Depth-First Search
2. Uniform Cost Search
3. A* Search
